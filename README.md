# Global Computer Solutions (GCS) Database Project

A comprehensive database management system for tracking employees, projects, skills, and billing for a consulting company.

## üìã Project Overview

This project implements a fully normalized relational database for Global Computer Solutions, a company that manages consulting projects across multiple regions. The database tracks employee skills, project assignments, task management, and billing information.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

The database consists of 11 interconnected tables designed in Third Normal Form (3NF):

### Core Entities
- **REGION**: Geographic regions where the company operates
- **CUSTOMER**: Client information and regional assignments
- **EMPLOYEE**: Staff member details and hire information
- **SKILL**: Available skills with hourly billing rates
- **PROJECT**: Project details, budgets, and timelines

### Operational Tables
- **PROJECT_TASK**: Individual tasks within projects
- **ASSIGNMENT**: Employee-to-task assignments
- **WORK_LOG**: Time tracking for billable hours
- **BILL**: Billing records for projects

### Junction Tables
- **EMPLOYEE_SKILL**: Many-to-many relationship between employees and their skills
- **TASK_SKILL**: Skills required for specific tasks

- Microsoft SQL Server (2016 or later)
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gcs-database-project.git
   cd gcs-database-project
   ```

2. **Create the database**
   - Open SQL Server Management Studio
   - Connect to your SQL Server instance
   - Create a new database named `GCS_Database`

3. **Run the schema script**

   GO
   -- Run database_schema.sql
   ```

## üìä Available Reports

The project includes three comprehensive business intelligence reports:

### 1. Employee Skills Utilization Report
**File**: `reports/employee_skills_report.sql`

Tracks how effectively employee skills are being utilized across projects, including:
- Employee skill inventory
- Hours worked per skill
- Total billable amounts
- Project involvement metrics
